# Computer Programming Project - 2022 | INE@[FITM.KMUTNB](https://github.com/FITM-KMUTNB)
Learning Objectives
- To learn how to use Python programming language.
- To learn how to use Git and GitHub.

## 1. Python Programming Language
- Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
- Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
- Python is designed to be highly readable.
- It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
- Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
- I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:
    - Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
    - Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
    - Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
    - Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
    - Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.
- Python is a great language for beginners and experienced programmers.
- Python is a general-purpose programming language.

## 2. Git and GitHub
- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
- Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.
- It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
- GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
- It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
- This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests.
- You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
- No coding necessary
